Friday:
* benchmarking (plots of time vs. ...)
    * C++ distance
        * N (update auto in distance_matrix)
        * D
        * radius
    * Embedding
        * N
        * radius

Next Week:
* test functions
    * embedding/
        * isomap.py
        * ltsa.py -- null_space for different solvers
        * locally_linear.py -- null_space for different solvers 
        * spectral_decomposition.py -- compare output with D's matlab
    * utils/
        * eigendecomp.py -- don't test validity of eigh, lobpcg etc just warnings, failures etc. 
    * geometry/
        * distance.py -- done 
        * geometry.py -- 
            * affinity_matrix()
            * laplacian_matrix()
            * Geometry class

After Paper:

* Remove debugging code
* Update comments 
* C++ integration 
* Turn into package
* Handbook/README 

Future Work:

* Natively support k-nearest neighbors as well as radius 
* Lazy R-metric updates
* R-metric covariance plotting tool

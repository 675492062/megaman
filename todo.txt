Wednesday: 
* Spectral Embedding: add diffusion_map option 
* Isomap: create K as a self.object and D_g
* clean geometry parameters -> Need to be careful here 
Thursday:
* benchmarking
    * C++ distance timing 
    * Embedding time with N 
Friday & Next Week 
* test functions:
    * isomap
    * ltsa
    * lle
    * spectral -- output from matlab
    * eigendecomp
    * geometry 

After Paper:

* remove debugging code
    * C++ code prints timing
* comments
* C++ work
* turn into package

Future Work:

* k-nearest neighbors as well as radius 
* Lazy R metric updates
* R metric plotting tool

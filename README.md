JMCQ:
Created Development Branch for compiling into working library.
 
TO DO: (no particular order)

* Finish testing functions (embedding & geometry input/output checking, warnings) 
* Migrate C++ executable code to cython or ctypes 
* Update any 'auto' modes -- based on benchmarking times
* Turn into 'proper' package
* Update function comments with parameters & attributes
* Complete README w/ examples
* Covar plotter example

Version 2:

* Native support for K-Nearest Neighbors distance 
* Lazy R-metric (only calcualte on select points)
* More general Covar Plotter w/ R metric (?)
